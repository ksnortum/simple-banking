# simple-banking
A very simple banking system from an excersize on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org).  About the only thing interesting here is an implementation 
of the Luhn Algorithm, which adds a check number to a credit card number so that you can do some validation before the number gets checked against
the database.

There is also some work with [sqlite](https://sqlite.org/index.html), JDBC and SQL that might interest a beginner. I use a very simple DAO for the 
cards/accounts table.
